# 2048

### Objective
We started this project to replicate the code of a well known game called 2048. The goal is to connect the same numbers so they multiply to 2048. We started this project to practice what we learned about 2D arrays. We had to create a variety of methods in order to get the tiles to move and combine with other tiles. 

### What I Learned
This was a fun experience for me because I got to apply everything we learned about 2D arrays while recreating a game that I play often. I learned how to connect the rules of 2D arrays to "real life" scenarios and create a runnable program.
